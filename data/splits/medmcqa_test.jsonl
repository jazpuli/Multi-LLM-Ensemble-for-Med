B: Normal HbF and normal HbA2Alpha (0) thalassemia -Individuals with this disorder are not able to produce any functional alpha-globin and thus are unable to make any functional hemoglobin A, F, or A2. This leads to the development of hydrops fetalis, also known as hemoglobin Ba, a condition that is incompatible with extra uterine life.Alpha (+) thalassemia - genetic mutations that result in decreased production of alpha-globin usually due to the functional deletion of 1 of the 4 alpha globin genes. Based on the number of inherited alpha genes, it is subclassified into 3 general forms:Thalassemia (-u/ a a) is characterized by inheritance of 3 normal a-genes. These patients are referred to clinically as silent carrier of alpha thalassemia. Other names for this condition are alpha thalassemia minima, alpha thalassemia-2 trait, and heterozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia minor. The affected individuals exhibit no abnormality clinically and may be hematologically normal or have mild reductions in red cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of 2 normal alpha genes due to either heterozygosity for alpha (0) thalassemia (u a/ --) or homozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia (-u/-a) results in the development of alpha thalassemia minor or alpha thalassemia-1 trait. The affected individuals are clinically normal but frequently have minimal anemia and reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of one normal alpha gene (-a/ --) results in abundant formation of hemoglobin H. This condition is known as ElbH disease. The affected individuals have moderate to severe lifelong hemolytic anemia, modest degrees of ineffective erythropoiesis, splenomegaly and variable bony changesPersons with alpha-thalassemia traits have normal HbA2 and HbF levels whereas beta- thalassemia patients have elevated HbA2", "subject": "Medicine", "topic": null}

(i.e., interlocking and plowing are not significant components of the total frictional resistance). \nAlthough NiTi has greater surface roughness, beta-Ti has greater frictional resistance, it turns out that as the titanium content of an alloy increases, its surface reactivity increases, and the surface chemistry is a major influence on frictional behavior.

The amount of maxillary movement is influenced by a number of factors like:\n\nAmount of force: Successful maxillary protraction can be brought about by 300-500 gm of force per side in the primary or mixed dentition.\nDirection of force: According to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.\n\tIn most cases of maxillary deficiency, maxilla is deficient in the vertical plane as well, therefore, a slight downward, direction of force is usually desirable. The line of force passes below the center of resistance of the maxilla producing a counter-clockwise moment on the maxilla and dentition. This results in a possible extrusion of maxillary posterior teeth leading to a downward and backward rotation of the mandible.\n\tHowever, in patients with increased anterior facial height, downward pull is contradicted.\nDuration of force: A review of literature shows duration to vary between 3 and 16 months. On an average at least 8-12 months of wear is required to produce the desired effect.\nFrequency of use: 12-14 hrs/day.\n\nKey Concept:\nAccording to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.\nReference: Textbook of orthodontics 2nd ed Gurkeerat Singh page no 502", "subject": "Dental", "topic": null}

It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload.

C: Nitrous oxideGeneral anaesthesia can be induced by intravenous (IV) injection, or breathing a volatile anaesthetic through a facemask (inhalational induction).Onset of anaesthesia is faster with IV injection than with inhalation, taking about 10-20 seconds to induce total unconsciousness.This has the advantage of avoiding the excitatory phase of anaesthesia, and thus reduces complications related to induction of anaesthesia.An inhalational induction may be chosen by the anesthesiologist where IV access is difficult to obtain, where difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or due to patient preference (e.g. children).Commonly used IV induction agents include propofol, sodium thiopental, etomidate, and ketamine.The most commonly-used agent for inhalational induction is sevoflurane because it causes less irritation than other inhaled gasesIn order to prolong anaesthesia for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained. Usually this is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen, nitrous oxide, and a volatile anaesthetic agent or by having a carefully controlled infusion of medication, usually propofol, through an IV.Induction Characteristics & Dosage Requirements for Currently AvailableSedative & Hypnotic DrugsDrug NameInduction Dose (mg/kg)Onset (sec)Duration (min)Thiopental3-6<305-10Methohexital1-3<305-10Propofol1.5-2.515-455-10Midazolam0.2-0,430-9010-30Diazepam0.3-0.645-9015-30Lorazepam0.03-0.0660-12060-120Etomidate0.2-0.33-123-12Ketamine1-210-2010-20", "subject": "Anaesthesia", "topic": null}

Psoas abscesses may arise from a hematogenous source, by contiguous spread from an intra- abdominal or pelvic process, or by contiguous spread from nearby bony structures (e.g., veebral bodies). Associated osteomyelitis due to spread from bone to muscle or from muscle to bone is common in psoas abscesses. When pott's disease was common, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was a frequent cause of psoas abscess. Currently, either S. aureus or a mixture of enteric organisms including aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli is usually isolated from psoas abscesses in the United States. S. aureus is most likely to be isolated when a psoas abscess arises from hematogenous spread or a contiguous focus of osteomyelitis; a mixed enteric flora is the most likely etiology when the abscess has an intra- abdominal or pelvic source. Patients with psoas abscesses frequently present with fever, lower abdominal or back pain, or pain referred to the hip or knee. CT is the most useful diagnostic technique.\"- Harrison 19/e p852 \"Spinal TB (Pott's disease or tuberculous spondylitis) often involves two or more adjacent veebral bodies. Whereas the upper thoracic spine is the most common site of spinal TB in children, the lower thoracic and upper lumbar veebrae are usually affected in adults. From the anterior superior or inferior angle of the veebral body, the lesion slowly reaches the adjacent body, later affecting the interveebral disk. With advanced disease, collapse of veebral bodies results in kyphosis (gibbus). A paraveebral \"cold\" abscess may also form. In the upper spine, this abscess may track to and penetrate the chest wall, presenting as a soft tissue mass; in the lower spine, it may reach the inguinal ligaments or present as a psoas abscess. \"Harrison 19/e p1110", "subject": "Surgery", "topic": "AIIMS 2017"}

These divide and acquire haemoglobin, which turns the cytoplasm pink; the nucleus condenses and is extruded from the cell. The ﬁrst non-nucleated red cell is a reticulocyte, which still contains ribosomal material in the cytoplasm, giving these large cells a faint blue tinge (‘polychromasia’). Reticulocytes lose their ribosomal material and mature over 3 days, during which time they are released into the circulation. Increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes (reticulocytosis) reflect increased erythropoiesis.\nProliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors is stimulated by erythropoietin, a polypeptide hormone produced by renal interstitial peritubular cells in response to hypoxia. Failure of erythropoietin production in patients with renal failure causes anaemia, which can be treated with exogenous recombinant erythropoietin or similar pharmacological agents called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, e.g. darbepoetin.\nReference: : Davidson P R I N C I P L E S   and Practice O F M E D I C I N E 23rd edition page no  915", "subject": "Medicine", "topic": null}
