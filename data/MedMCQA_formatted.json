The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of fluid entering it Guyton I LpJ1 4-.;anong 23/e p653-6_)Glomerular oncotic pressure (due to plasma protein content) is higher than that of filtrate oncotic pressure in Bowman's capsule. Since glucose is freely filtered and the fluid in the Bowman's capsule is isotonic with plasma, the concentration of glucose in the filtrate is the same as in the capillaries",

Glycogen synthesisLow insulin to glucagon ratio implies a catabolic state, i.e. usage of body stores to form energy, typically seen in fasting state ancl diabetes mellitus. Hence, this state will promote glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis as well as ketone body formation, while at the same time inhibiting glycogen synthesis and storage.",

    "explanation": "*Kiesselbach's plexus: Antero superior pa is supplied by ANTERIOR & POSTERIOR ETHMOIDAL AERIES which are branches of ophthalmic aery, branch of INTERNAL CAROTID AERY. Antero inferior pa is supplied by SUPERIOR LABIAL AERY - branch of facial aery, which is branch of EXTERNAL CAROTID AERY. Postero superior pa is supplied by SPHENO-PALATINE AERY - branch of MAXILLARY aery, which is branch of ECA. POSTERO INFERIOR pa is supplied by branches of GREATER PALATINE AERY - branch of ECA Antero inferior pa/vestibule of septum contain anastomosis b/w septal ramus of superior labial branch of facial aery & branches of sphenopalatine, greater palatine & anterior ethmoidal aeries. These form a large capillary network called KIESSELBACH'S PLEXUS If dryness persists, bleeding will occur Therefore, in given options, Anterior ethmoidal aery is a branch of ICA not ECA",
